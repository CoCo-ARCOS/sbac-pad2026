# Distributed Machine Learning: Bridging Cloud and Edge Systems

Edge-cloud solutions are being used to collect and analyze large amounts of data generated by IoT
devices in various application domains, such as urban mobility, smart cities, healthcare, and
augmented reality. We must be able to combine techniques and algorithms of data analysis and
machine learning with the scalable architectures of Cloud systems and Edge technologies. This
approach can reduce latency and network congestion associated with traditional cloud-based
machine learning techniques by processing data locally on edge devices before sending it to the
cloud for further analysis. This keynote discusses distributed machine learning and proposes a
reference architecture to adapt distributed machine learning algorithms at the edge-cloud
continuum. Real applications are presented, and the main open research issues are discussed.

**Speaker**: Domenico Talia is a full professor of computer engineering at the University of Calabria, Italy and
an Honorary professor at Noida University, India. He is a co-founder of the start-up DtoK Lab. His
research interests include Big Data analysis, high-performance computing, parallel and distributed
data mining algorithms, Cloud computing, distributed machine learning, social data analysis, peer-
to-peer systems, and parallel programming models and languages. Domenico Talia has published
10 books and more than 400 papers in archival journals such as Communications of the ACM, IEEE
TPDS, IEEE Computer, IEEE TKDE, IEEE TSE, IEEE TSMC-A, IEEE TSMC-B, IEEE Micro, ACM Computing
Surveys, FGCS, Parallel Computing, IEEE Internet Computing, and highly reputed conference
proceedings. He is a member of the editorial boards of IEEE Transactions on Parallel and
Distributed Systems, IEEE Computer, ACM Computing Surveys, the Future Generation Computer
Systems journal, the International Journal of Web and Grid Services, the Journal of Cloud
Computing-Advances, Systems and Applications, the Scalable Computing Practice and Experience
journal, the International Journal of Next-Generation Computing. He was guest editor of special
issues of IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, Parallel Computing, IEEE Transactions on Big
Data, and Future Generation Computer Systems, and served as a program chair or program
committee member of several international conferences. Talia is a senior member of the
Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and IEEE Computer Society and has been a reviewer
for several research agencies and public administrations.
