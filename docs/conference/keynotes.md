# Distributed Machine Learning: Bridging Cloud and Edge Systems

Edge-cloud solutions are being used to collect and analyze large amounts of data generated by IoT
devices in various application domains, such as urban mobility, smart cities, healthcare, and
augmented reality. We must be able to combine techniques and algorithms of data analysis and
machine learning with the scalable architectures of Cloud systems and Edge technologies. This
approach can reduce latency and network congestion associated with traditional cloud-based
machine learning techniques by processing data locally on edge devices before sending it to the
cloud for further analysis. This keynote discusses distributed machine learning and proposes a
reference architecture to adapt distributed machine learning algorithms at the edge-cloud
continuum. Real applications are presented, and the main open research issues are discussed.

# Tasks based hybrid workflows for emergent technologies

TBD

![Image title](https://coco-arcos.github.io/sbac-pad2026/assets/imgs/keynotes/badia.jpg){ align=left width="35%" }

**Speaker**:  *<span style="color: #010E77">Rosa M. Badia</span>* holds a PhD in Computer Science (1994) from the Technical University of Catalonia (UPC). She is the director of the HPC software research area and the manager of the Workflows and Distributed Computing research group, both roles at the Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC, Spain). 
Her research has contributed to parallel programming models for multicore and distributed computing. Recent contributions have focused on the digital continuum, proposing new programming environments and software for edge-to-cloud, as well as for the support of hybrid quantum-classic workflows. The research is integrated in PyCOMPSs/COMPSs, a parallel task-based programming distributed computing framework, and its application to developing large heterogeneous workflows that combine HPC, Big Data, and Machine Learning. The group is also doing research around the dislib, a parallel machine learning library parallelized with PyCOMPSs. Dr Badia has published more than 200 papers on her research topics in international conferences and journals. She has been very active in projects funded by the European Commission and in contracts with industry. She was the PI of the EuroHPC project eFlows4HPC.
She is a member of the EuroHPC JU RIAG and a member of the HiPEAC Network of Excellence. She received the Euro-Par Achievement Award 2019, the DonaTIC award, category Academia/Researcher in 2019 and the HPDC Achievement Award 2021. Since 2023 she is a member of the Institut d'Estudis Catalans (Catalan academy). She is the chair of the ACM Europe Council.
