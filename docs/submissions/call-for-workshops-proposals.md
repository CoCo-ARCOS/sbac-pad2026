# Call for Workshop and Tutorials Proposals

The 38th IEEE/SBC International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing (SBAC-PAD) invites proposals for workshops that provide a forum for discussions among researchers and practitioners on focused and timely topics within the fields of Computer Architecture and High-Performance Computing (HPC).

For this edition, we are particularly interested in emerging and transformative topics, including but not limited to:

*⁠ ⁠HPC for healthcare, genomics, and life sciences applications.
*⁠ ⁠Big data management and analytics in HPC environments.
*⁠ ⁠Energy-efficient, thermal-aware, and sustainable HPC systems.
*⁠ ⁠AI-driven HPC: adaptive, self-optimizing, and “thinking” computer systems.
*⁠ ⁠Quantum computing and its integration with HPC architectures.
*⁠ ⁠Heterogeneous and collaborative computing at extreme scales.
*⁠ ⁠Edge and cloud convergence for HPC workloads.
*⁠ ⁠Security, resilience, and fault tolerance in large-scale HPC infrastructures.
*⁠ ⁠Software quality, verification, and correctness in HPC applications.
*⁠ ⁠Flexible, scalable, and domain-specific architectures for next-generation computing.

## Workshop Format and Publication

Organizers are free to structure workshops as they see fit, incorporating invited talks, panel discussions, presentations of work in progress, fully peer-reviewed papers, or a combination of these. Workshops may be scheduled as half-day or full-day events.

Accepted, peer-reviewed workshop papers will be included in the SBAC-PAD 2026 proceedings and published in the IEEE Xplore Digital Library. Each paper must receive at least three independent reviews to be eligible for publication.

## Important dates

* Deadline for Workshop and Tutorial Proposals: April 15th, 2026 (AoE)
* Notification of acceptance: April 30th, 2026

## Submission Guidelines

Workshop proposals must be submitted in PDF format and must include:

* Workshop name, acronym, and duration (half-day or full-day).
* Brief description of the workshop (0.5 – 1 page).
⁠* List of topics covered and their relevance to the SBAC-PAD community.
* Organizers’ details: names, affiliations, and short bios (5-10 lines).
