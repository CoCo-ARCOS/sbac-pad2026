# Call for Papers

The 38th IEEE/SBC Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing will take place from October 14 to 16 at Madrid, Spain.

SBAC-PAD is an annual international conference series, which presents the latest trends, current research and developments, and novel tools and applications in the fields of Computer Architecture, High-Performance Computing, and Parallel and Distributed Computing technologies. SBAC-PAD is open to industry, faculty, researchers, practitioners, and undergraduate and graduate students from around the world. Its scientific program is composed of high-quality submitted papers, selected by a thorough peer review process, and invited talks from renowned researchers. 

## Important dates
